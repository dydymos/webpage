Tomek Włodarski is a computational biophysicist working as a research fellow in John Christodoulou group at UCL. His background is in multi-scale simulations of proteins and large protein-RNA complexes. Through my research, I have not only advanced my simulations portfolio but have crucially developed a very strong understanding of the details of NMR and cryo-EM data to extract structural, dynamic and mechanistic information and applied these to my strategies, enabling me to make predictions and to design experiments. I have built experience in computational chemistry, bioinformatics, integrative structural biology and protein folding, which put me in a unique position to work on the cross-section of chemistry, physics and biology.
