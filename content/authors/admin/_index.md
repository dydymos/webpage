I am a computational biophysicist working as a research fellow in the Department of Bioinformatics at IBB PAS in Warsaw, Poland. My primary focus is on a project titled _'Co-translational protein folding in the light of ribosome evolution.'_ funded by the POLONEZ BIS grant from the National Science Centre. This project integrates bioinformatics, multi-scale molecular dynamics simulations and machine learning to unravel the complexities of ribosome heterogeneity, particularly around the exit tunnel, and its influence on the co-translational folding of proteins.
During my postdoctorate stay at UCL in John Christodoulou's group and at the University of Cambridge in Michele Vendruscolo's group, I have developed all-atom and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of ribosomal nascent chain complexes with structural restraints derived from experimental data (mainly NMR and cryo-EM). Additionally, I have developed _CryoENsemble_ - a computational method based on Bayesian inference to re-weight structural ensemble obtained from MD simulations to better capture heterogeneity in cryo-EM data. Using these tools, I have characterised in atomic detail the nascent chain structural ensembles, folding intermediate states and interactions between the ribosome and unfolded or folded nascent chains.
