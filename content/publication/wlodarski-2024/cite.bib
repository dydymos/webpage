abstract = {Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-{EM}) has emerged as a powerful method for the determination of structures of complex biological molecules. The accurate characterisation of the dynamics of such systems, however, remains a challenge. To address this problem, we introduce {cryoENsemble}, a method that applies Bayesian reweighting to conformational ensembles derived from molecular dynamics simulations to improve their agreement with cryo-{EM} data, thus enabling the extraction of dynamics information. We illustrate the use of {cryoENsemble} to determine the dynamics of the ribosome-bound state of the co-translational chaperone trigger factor ({TF}). We also show that {cryoENsemble} can assist with the interpretation of low-resolution, noisy or unaccounted regions of cryo-{EM} maps. Notably, we are able to link an unaccounted part of the cryo-{EM} map to the presence of another protein (methionine aminopeptidase, or {MetAP}), rather than to the dynamics of {TF}, and model its {TF}-bound state. Based on these results, we anticipate that {cryoENsemble} will find use for challenging heterogeneous cryo-{EM} maps for biomolecular systems encompassing dynamic components. \copyright 2024.
