abstract = {Noncovalent binding interactions between proteins are the central physicochemical phenomenon underlying biological signaling and functional control on the molecular level. Here, we perform an extensive structural analysis of a large set of bound and unbound ubiquitin conformers and study the level of residual induced fit after conformational selection in the binding process. We show that the region surrounding the binding site in ubiquitin undergoes conformational changes that are significantly more pronounced compared with the whole molecule on average. We demonstrate that these induced-fit structural adjustments are comparable in magnitude to conformational selection. Our final model of ubiquitin binding blends conformational selection with the subsequent induced fit and provides a quantitative measure of their respective contributions.}

The molecular mechanisms by which these processes take place, however, remain largely unknown, in particular in the case of intrinsically disordered proteins ({IDPs}). To address this question, we studied at a residue-specific level the structure and dynamics of ribosome-nascent chain complexes ({RNCs}) of \alpha-synuclein ({\alphaSyn}), an {IDP} associated with Parkinson's disease ({PD}). Using solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance ({NMR}) spectroscopy and coarse-grained molecular dynamics ({MD}) simulations, we find that, although the nascent chain ({NC}) has a highly disordered conformation, its N-terminal region shows resonance broadening consistent with interactions involving specific regions of the ribosome surface. We also investigated the effects of the ribosome-associated molecular chaperone trigger factor ({TF}) on {\alphaSyn} structure and dynamics using resonance broadening to define a footprint of the {TF}-{RNC} interactions. We have used these data to construct structural models that suggest specific ways by which emerging {NCs} can interact with the biosynthesis and quality control machinery.}

Here we used solution-state {NMR} spectroscopy to define a structural ensemble of a ribosome-nascent chain complex ({RNC}) formed during protein biosynthesis in Escherichia coli, in which a pair of immunoglobulin-like domains adopts a folded N-terminal domain ({FLN5}) and a disordered but compact C-terminal domain ({FLN6}). To study how {FLN5} acquires its native structure cotranslationally, we progressively shortened the {RNC} constructs. We found that the ribosome modulates the folding process, because the complete sequence of {FLN5} emerged well beyond the tunnel before acquiring native structure, whereas {FLN5} in isolation folded spontaneously, even when truncated. This finding suggests that regulating structure acquisition during biosynthesis can reduce the probability of misfolding, particularly of homologous domains.}

abstract = {Viral capsids are structurally constrained by interactions among the amino acids ({AAs}) of their constituent proteins. Therefore, epistasis is expected to evolve among physically interacting sites and to influence the rates of substitution. To study the evolution of epistasis, we focused on the major structural protein of the ϕX174 phage family by first reconstructing the ancestral protein sequences of 18 species using a Bayesian statistical framework. The inferred ancestral reconstruction differed at eight {AAs}, for a total of 256 possible ancestral haplotypes. For each ancestral haplotype and the extant species, we estimated, in silico, the distribution of free energies and epistasis of the capsid structure. We found that free energy has not significantly increased but epistasis has. We decomposed epistasis up to fifth order and found that higher-order epistasis sometimes compensates pairwise interactions making the free energy seem additive. The {dN}/{dS} ratio is low, suggesting strong purifying selection, and that structure is under stabilizing selection. We synthesized phages carrying ancestral haplotypes of the coat protein gene and measured their fitness experimentally. Our findings indicate that stabilizing mutations can have higher fitness, and that fitness optima do not necessarily coincide with energy minima. \copyright 2017 The Authors.}

abstract = {Methylation is one of the most common chemical modifications of biologically active molecules and it occurs in all life forms. Its functional role is very diverse and involves many essential cellular processes, such as signal transduction, transcriptional control, biosynthesis, and metabolism. Here, we provide further insight into the enzymatic methylation in S. cerevisiae by conducting a comprehensive structural and functional survey of all the methyltransferases encoded in its genome. Using distant homology detection and fold recognition, we found that the S. cerevisiae methyltransferome comprises 86 {MTases} (53 well-known and 33 putative with unknown substrate specificity). Structural classification of their catalytic domains shows that these enzymes may adopt nine different folds, the most common being the Rossmann-like. We also analyzed the domain architecture of these proteins and identified several new domain contexts. Interestingly, we found that the majority of {MTase} genes are periodically expressed during yeast metabolic cycle. This finding, together with calculated isoelectric point, fold assignment and cellular localization, was used to develop a novel approach for predicting substrate specificity. Using this approach, we predicted the general substrates for 24 of 33 putative {MTases} and confirmed these predictions experimentally in both cases tested. Finally, we show that, in S. cerevisiae, methylation is carried out by 34 {RNA} {MTases}, 32 protein {MTases}, eight small molecule {MTases}, three lipid {MTases}, and nine {MTases} with still unknown substrate specificity.}

abstract = {Cotranslational folding ({CTF}) is a fundamental molecular process that ensures efficient protein biosynthesis and minimizes the formation of misfolded states. However, the complexity of this process makes it extremely challenging to obtain structural characterizations of {CTF} pathways. Here, we correlate observations of translationally arrested nascent chains with those of a systematic C-terminal truncation strategy. We create a detailed description of chain length-dependent free energy landscapes associated with folding of the {FLN5} filamin domain, in isolation and on the ribosome, and thus, quantify a substantial destabilization of the native structure on the ribosome. We identify and characterize two folding intermediates formed in isolation, including a partially folded intermediate associated with the isomerization of a conserved cis proline residue. The slow folding associated with this process raises the prospect that neighboring unfolded domains might accumulate and misfold during biosynthesis. We develop a simple model to quantify the risk of misfolding in this situation and show that catalysis of folding by peptidyl-prolyl isomerases is sufficient to eliminate this hazard.

It has been suggested that interactions between the emerging polypeptide and the ribosome surface might allow the ribosome itself to modulate co-translational folding. Here we combine protein engineering and {NMR} spectroscopy to characterize a series of interactions between the ribosome surface and unfolded nascent chains of the immunoglobulin-like {FLN5} filamin domain. The strongest interactions are found for a C-terminal segment that is essential for folding, and we demonstrate quantitative agreement between the strength of this interaction and the energetics of the co-translational folding process itself. Mutations in this region that reduce the extent of binding result in a shift in the co-translational folding equilibrium towards the native state. Our results therefore demonstrate that a competition between folding and binding provides a simple, dynamic mechanism for the modulation of co-translational folding by the ribosome. \copyright 2021.

abstract = {The folding of many proteins can begin during biosynthesis on the ribosome and can be modulated by the ribosome itself. Such perturbations are generally believed to be mediated through interactions between the nascent chain and the ribosome surface, but despite recent progress in characterising interactions of unfolded states with the ribosome, and their impact on the initiation of co-translational folding, a complete quantitative analysis of interactions across both folded and unfolded states of a nascent chain has yet to be realised. Here we apply solution-state {NMR} spectroscopy to measure transverse proton relaxation rates for methyl groups in folded ribosome-nascent chain complexes of the {FLN5} filamin domain. We observe substantial increases in relaxation rates for the nascent chain relative to the isolated domain, which can be related to changes in effective rotational correlation times using measurements of relaxation and cross-correlated relaxation in the isolated domain. Using this approach, we can identify interactions between the nascent chain and the ribosome surface, driven predominantly by electrostatics, and by measuring the change in these interactions as the subsequent {FLN6} domain emerges, we may deduce their impact on the free energy landscapes associated with the co-translational folding process.

Addressing this question has strong implications to health and disease. Ribosomes play an essential role in maintaining a healthy cellular proteome by modulating co-translational folding.

Here, we report high-resolution cryo-{EM} structures of stalled ribosome nascent-chain complexes ({RNCs}) at two biosynthetic translation time-points that examine the role of the ribosome during co-translational folding. Structures of the {RNCs} reveal that {NC} is highly dynamic and adopts a range of trajectories within the vestibule of the exit tunnel, affecting positions of the folded immunoglobulin domain outside the ribosome.

To understand how this process is modulated by the shape and surface of the narrow tunnel, we have rationally engineered three exit tunnel protein loops ({uL22}, {uL23} and {uL24}) of the {70S} ribosome by {CRISPR}/Cas9 gene editing, and studied the co-translational folding of an immunoglobulin-like filamin domain ({FLN5}). Our thermodynamics measurements employing {19F}/{15N}/methyl-{TROSY} {NMR} spectroscopy together with cryo-{EM} and molecular dynamics simulations reveal how the variations in the lengths of the loops present across species exert their distinct effects on the free energy of {FLN5} folding. A concerted interplay of the {uL23} and {uL24} loops is sufficient to alter co-translational folding energetics, which we highlight by the opposite folding outcomes resulting from their extensions. These subtle modulations occur through a combination of the steric effects relating to the shape of the tunnel, the dynamic interactions between the ribosome surface and the unfolded nascent chain, and its altered exit pathway within the vestibule. These results illustrate the role of the exit tunnel structure in co-translational folding, and provide principles for how to remodel it to elicit a desired folding outcome. \copyright 2022.

The origin of this folding modulation by the ribosome has remained unknown. Here we have determined atomistic structures of the unfolded state of a model protein on and off the ribosome, which reveal that the ribosome structurally expands the unfolded nascent chain and increases its solvation, resulting in its entropic destabilization relative to the peptide chain in isolation. Quantitative {19F} {NMR} experiments confirm that this destabilization reduces the entropic penalty of folding by up to 30 kcal mol-1 and promotes formation of partially folded intermediates on the ribosome, an observation that extends to other protein domains and is obligate for some proteins to acquire their active conformation. The thermodynamic effects also contribute to the ribosome protecting the nascent chain from mutation-induced unfolding, which suggests a crucial role of the ribosome in supporting protein evolution. By correlating nascent chain structure and dynamics to their folding energetics and post-translational outcomes, our findings establish the physical basis of the distinct thermodynamics of co-translational protein folding. \copyright 2024.

To address this problem, we introduce {cryoENsemble}, a method that applies Bayesian reweighting to conformational ensembles derived from molecular dynamics simulations to improve their agreement with cryo-{EM} data, thus enabling the extraction of dynamics information. We illustrate the use of {cryoENsemble} to determine the dynamics of the ribosome-bound state of the co-translational chaperone trigger factor ({TF}). We also show that {cryoENsemble} can assist with the interpretation of low-resolution, noisy or unaccounted regions of cryo-{EM} maps. Notably, we are able to link an unaccounted part of the cryo-{EM} map to the presence of another protein (methionine aminopeptidase, or {MetAP}), rather than to the dynamics of {TF}, and model its {TF}-bound state. Based on these results, we anticipate that {cryoENsemble} will find use for challenging heterogeneous cryo-{EM} maps for biomolecular systems encompassing dynamic components. \copyright 2024.
